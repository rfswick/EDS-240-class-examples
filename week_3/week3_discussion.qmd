## Example 1: `{palmerpenguins}` ggplot

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-alt: "Stacked histogram of penguin body masses in grams for three species of penguins: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. Gentoo penguins have the highest average body mass by 1500 grams."
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, 
                 position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Body mass (g)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Penguin body masses")
```

##Example 2: From the New York Times ![](nyt-monthly-temp.png){fig-alt="Dot plot of monthly global temperature compared with the average temperature for the 20th century. After 1975, all average monthly global temperatures are higher than the 20th century average."}

## Example 3: Fig 1A from Chapman et al. 2024
